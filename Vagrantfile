  # Example for VirtualBox:
  #
  config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb|

    # vb.gui = true

    # Customize the amount of memory on the VM:

  # Puppet, Chef, Ansible, Salt, and Docker are also available. Please see the
  # documentation for more information about their specific syntax and use.
